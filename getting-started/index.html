                        If you managed to get here you probably know about microcontrollers. But you might not know what
                        you need in order to get started. The truth is that electronics isn't a more expansive of a
                        hobby than say woodworking.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="mt-4 mb-4"/>
                    <h5 class="fw-semibold">TOOLS:</h5>
                    <div class="chapter ms-4 pt-3">
                        <h4><b>Light:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            Get yourself some sort of work light, the better lit your work area is the easier it
                            will be to work. I picked up a small florescent light fixture for under $30 bucks,
                            and it works great.
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Digital Multi-Meter:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            Any multi meter will do that can measure DC voltage, AC voltage, resistance and
                            current. I use a $200 meter at work and it does the same job that the meter that i
                            got at the local hardware shop on special for $15. The only difference is that the
                            one we use at work is weatherproof, do high 600V testing (which you will not need)
                            and can take a 3-story fall.
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Flush Cutters:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            You can pick up a pair for a few bucks. They are great for working with electronics.
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Wire strippers:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            There are many styles of Wire strippers. Stay away from the automatic strippers (especially
                            the butterfly style). I use to build electrical panels for a living, so I use to strip a lot
                            of wire, and <a
                                href="https://www.kleintools.com/catalog/strippers-cutters-and-crimpers/wire-strippers/combination-cable-and-wire-stripping-tools"
                                target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klein Wire Cutters</a> are THE BEST, its worth spending
                            the extra bit of money for conform. As a hobbyist you will work with smaller wire gages (the
                            higher the AWG# the smaller the wire). I find 22AWG a really nice gage to work with.
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Breadboard:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            A breadboard is a prototype board, it is used to prototype circuits without having
                            to solder components together, A must-have.
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Soldering Iron:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            You can go without a soldering as long as you do not want to build
                            anything permanent. When you do decide to spend some money buy the <a
                                href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/85" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AOYUE
                            2900</a>. Its 70 watt, it heats up fast (2-5 seconds), the tips last a long time,
                            the tips are inexpensive (and contain the heater element, so when you replace the
                            tip you also replace the heater). The problem with cheap irons is that they are not
                            meant to last, the heater and the tips are only good for 20-40 hours, and then your
                            stuck replacing them, and for the price of 5 cheap irons you could own this one

                        <h4><b>Solder:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            There many types of solder on the market, The easiest to use is Leaded 63Sn/37Pb with a
                            water-soluble flux core, Although the no-clean stuff sounds good don't use it, it continues
                            to slowly eat at the board over time and requires worse chemicals than any other flux type
                            to fully clean off. Leaded 60Sn/40Pb with a Flux core is the most common solder found in
                            hardware stores. A good high quality solder will make soldering a lot easier. I do not
                            recommend Lead-Free (Silver) solder, it has a higher melting point and does not flow as
                            smoothly as Lead solder, in short, its a pain in the ass to use on a good day.
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Flux:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            Flux is basically a mild acid that you use to clean your soldering surfaces before
                            soldering. Using flux makes soldering much easier, the downside is that you need to clear
                            the flux off once you are done soldering or the acid will continue to eat at your board. I
                            highly recommend a Water soluble Flux, Standard flux requires Isopropyl Alcohol to clean.
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Wick:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            We all make mistakes, and sometimes being able to de-solder something is just as important
                            to solder something. Out of all the devices made for removing solder the wick is by far the
                            easiest and best (aside from an expansive hot air rework station).
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Wire:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            Wire is rated in AWG (American Wire Gage) the higher the number the thinker the wire
                            (basically this number states how many times a wire goes through a roller in order to get
                            its thickness, so a 30 AWG wire went through a roller 30 times). Use 26-30 AWG is a nice
                            thickness for electronics applications. Wire also comes in 2 varieties Stranded and Solid
                            core. Solid core is good for breadboards and Stranded is better for soldering. A wide array
                            of colors is recommended. I recommend Red (for positive power), Green(or white for ground)
                            and Black (for Signals). There are many different types of Insulation and any will do for
                            electronics.

                            It always comes in handy, the shiny stuff is the cheap stuff, avoid it.
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Heat Shrink:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            Heat shrink is great, It's basically a tube that shrinks to half it sizes when heated, this
                            is great for shielding wire after you have spliced 2 wires together. I use a lighter to
                            shrink heat-shrink (hold the heat shrink ABOVE the flame and turn slowly). Get the 1/8 inch
                            diameter stuff, that's good for most of the hobbyist applications.

                            The Arduino is a wicked piece of kit, it's a simple board with an AVR (at this time the

                            Resistors are the most common and versatile component used in electronics. 1/8 watt
                            resistors are inexpensive and will work for most applications, but if you could get 1/4 watt
                            resistors for the same cost nab them up, any rating higher than 1/4 Watt is used for special
                            applications thus are more expansive. 270,333,1k,4.7k and 10k are the most common used

                        <h4><b>Voltage Regulator:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            A great little device, that well... regulates the input voltage into a given value. In
                            simpler words, most devices work on 3.3V or 5V the voltage regulator reduces the power of a
                            standard 9V battery to your desired voltage.
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Transistor:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            While you're not going to need them right away, they do come in handy. Transistors have many
                            uses in electronics. trust me, add a few 'small signal' PNP and NPN transistors to your
                            electronics order, you'll be glad you did because eventually you will need them.
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Diode:</b></h4>
                        <p class="ms-4">
                            Diodes are another really common component used for many things, they are really cheap so
                            make sure you keep a few around. The 1N4001 diode is a nice generic choice.
                        </p>

                            Over time your parts shelf will grow larger and larger, but the above list is a great place
                            to start.
